# My Nushell Scripts

Here are some utility scripts I wrote in Nu, [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/)'s 
scripting language.

## Filenames

Nu files starting with a dot are used with `source` in my configuration. Others
are normally run as executables.

## Documentation

No docs, no warranty. Feel free to modify or use my code elsewhere.

Personally I think `mdmake.nu` may stand a chance elsewhere, others are simply
rubbish.

## License

This repository is UNLICENSED. All script files are in the public domain, except
for: 

- `.zoxide.nu` which is generated by zoxide and is subject to zoxide's license
